      <description>The Matrix 4 is coming out! I love this series and I can&amp;rsquo;t wait for it now.
  I personally like Matrix the 2nd and the 3rd ones as well, but I think they tend to have fewer fans because the story is more complicated and harder to understand compared to the 1st one. When I first saw them, I lost confidence in myself to follow the story in the middle of the 2nd, but after I realized that the structure of the story was similar to the manga version of Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind that I had read, I was able to enjoy watching it very much (whether I understood it properly or not).</description>
